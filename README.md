# Reddit Search App

Allows users to search reddit posts matching search criteria. User is able to select limit and relevance. The post's title, a 100 character description, image, subreddit and score are displayed on the card. Parcel was used to bundle everything together.

To run this app:
Install Parcel `npm i -g parcel-bundler`
then clone this repo and then `parcel index.html`.
When Parcel is running, follow the link in your terminal and you're good to go.
