# Reddit Search App

Allows users to search reddit posts matching search criteria. User is able to select limit and relevance. The post's title, a 100 character description, image, subreddit and score are displayed on the card. Parcel was used to bundle everything together.

To run this app, install Parcel (if you don't have it) by entering `npm i -g parcel-bundler` then clone this repo and: `parcel index.html`. When Parcel is running, follow the link in your terminal and you're good to go.
